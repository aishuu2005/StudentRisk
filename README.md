Student Engagement Risk Analyzer

Early Intervention System for Academic Success

Overview

This project delivers a practical solution to help institutions identify students who may be at risk of low academic engagement. The system uses key performance indicators to generate a risk score and presents the results through a clean and interactive dashboard. It enables faculty to take proactive steps and provide timely support.

Our focus is simplicity, speed, and immediate real-world usefulness.

Solution Highlights

• Automated risk score prediction for individual and batch student records
• Clear classification into High, Medium, and Low risk groups
• Interactive analytics dashboard for faculty decision support
• Scalable design that can fit into existing academic systems
• Built in under 8 hours with an optimized MVP approach

Technical Workflow

Input student data through form or CSV upload

Data preprocessing using stored scaler

Machine learning model generates risk probability

Risk class and insights displayed in dashboard

Machine Learning Artifacts:
