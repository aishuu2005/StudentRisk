Student Engagement Risk Analyzer
Early Risk Prediction and Intervention System
Solution Overview

This project introduces a data-driven system designed to identify students who show early signs of disengagement in higher education. By analyzing academic, behavioral, and socio-economic indicators, the model predicts a student’s engagement risk and provides actionable insights that enable timely intervention. The system helps institutions prevent academic decline and improve retention rates.

Key Features

• Predicts individual student engagement risk score
• High, Medium, and Low risk classification
• Analytical dashboard for monitoring and insights
• CSV upload for bulk predictions
• Simulation panel for testing improvements
• Intervention recommendations for faculty

The system can evolve into a fully integrated module within institutional academic management platforms.
